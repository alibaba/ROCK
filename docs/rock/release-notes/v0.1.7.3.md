## SDK

### New Features
* Added the `response_limited_bytes_in_nohup` parameter to the `Sandbox.arun()` method to address request timeouts caused by excessively long responses. See [Sandbox SDK Reference](../references/sandbox.md) for details.
* Added `read_file_by_line_range` to `Sandbox`. Note: this method does not guarantee exact fidelity with the original file content and may lose newline characters or other information.

### Upgrades
* Optimized wheel package dependencies to reduce the likelihood of conflicts with other projects.
